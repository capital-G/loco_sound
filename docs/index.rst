Loco Sound Documentation
========================

Welcome to the documentation of *loco sound* which provides
sound for your miniature trains
without the need to install a sound decoder into your locomotive
but by connecting a PC with speakers to your Z21 via LAN or WiFi.

You can map sound packets to specific locomotive numbers which will
trigger sounds on the machine `loco sound` is running on.
