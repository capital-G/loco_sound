# Ideas

* Receive UDP signals async via twisted, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/9981845

* Ping if z21 is available?

* Add ambient sounds for e.g. buildings, without decoder

* Allow non x_header messages natively without hack

* General ambient sounds for locos (dependent on speed?)

* Reschedule loop sounds

* Keep stack of speed changes for each loco to make stuff like brakes, durchdrehen etc possible

* Write SoundInterface for automatic looping etc on functions
